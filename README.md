Final touch - be notified with SMS

Replace 'YOUR_SMS_API_KEY' with your actual SMS API key or authentication credentials and 'YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER' with your phone number.

Additionally, update the 'https://api.example.com/sms/send' URL with the appropriate endpoint provided by your SMS gateway service.

Now, whenever the server status changes, the script will send an SMS notification to your specified phone number.

Remember to set up the script, create a log file, and configure it to work with your chosen SMS gateway service.
